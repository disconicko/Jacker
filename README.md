# Jacker
Automate Click Jacking

# How To Run
1. To run Jacker simply navigate to the vulnerable page in your browser. 
2. Open up dev tools, paste the jacker code into the console and press enter.
3. Once the javascript is running you will be able to add new input fields with the + button (as many as you want).
4. You can add your burpsuite collaborator or attacker controlled url to the example url field (this is where you want to see the content too after clickjacking).
5. Don't forget to move the submit button over the form submit button.
